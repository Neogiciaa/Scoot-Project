# **Scoot Project**

Here we go again! A new challenge is out, and this time, i am not alone because it's a duo project !

## Stack

HTML - SCSS 

## Start project

After cloning this repository, move inside the project folder using:

```bash
cd scoot-project
```

Then here are three ways to start it:

1. Drag and drop `index.html` file into your web browser

2. For WebStorm users → Click the green play button at the top of the IDE with the `index.html` file open

3. For VSCode users → Use the Live Server extension to open a local server with fast refresh

### Great news

We're glad to announce that we deployed the entire project on Vercel so you can see our work yourself!
