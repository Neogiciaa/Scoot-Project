HTML - SCSS 

## Start project

After cloning this repository, you will need to move inside project folder using:

```bash
cd scoot-project
```

Then here are three ways to start it:

1. Drag and drop `home.html` file into your web browser

2. For WebStorm users → Click the green play button at the top of the IDE with the `index.html` file open

3. For VSCode users → Use the Live Server extension to open a local server with fast refresh

### Great news

We're glag to anounce you that we pushed the entire project in Vercel so you can see by yourself our work !
